# Computer-Networking

This holds the code I wrote for my Computer Networking Module at Trinity College Dublin.

# Project 1
This one is about implement a blockchain based information logger, limited to a local host. It is mostly TCP/IP socket programming to make connections and then tries to imitate a blockchain network. 
The idea is to log the informatino from various devices, sort of like how a Diagnostic Report is sent and put in a blockchain so you can view various Issues on it just like Git allows you to. I liked this idea very much and I hope someday I can make this project a reality.
I have separate README file inside this folder which will tell you how to run the code and understand. It uses various modules like hashlib, os, socket and a lot of stuff that I also talk about in the report I have attached with it.

#Project 2
Coming soon....
